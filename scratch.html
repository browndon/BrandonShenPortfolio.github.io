		<img src="images/name.png"/ width= "400" height="400">

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the program when the green flash was clicked.
</p>

	<h2>Description</h2> 
	<p>Used scratch to present on what computer to buy on based on someone who we interviewâ€™s needs, and had to show why what computer was better and what each component of the computer did. We also presented it to the class after we were finished creating it.

	</p>
	<h2>Description</h2> 
	<p>Had to use our scratch knowledge to make a game or story, and we had to present it to others for it to be peer graded. I made a game where you play as a spaceship and you have to dodge the bullets of an enemy spaceship and two turrets while shooting back. The goal is to kill the enemy before you die.
