<h1="font-family:arial;">Why I like the movie</h1>
<p="font-family:arial;"> This movie has great acting and is able to speak to the viewer on a level above what is just shown in the film. It shows what it takes to be great, and what it takes to be the best, and it shows when in humiliation one should go back and seek redemption. I also play the drums, and this movie is about drums, so it was even more interesting to me because of this.</p>

<h1="font-family:arial;"> My favorite actor </h1>
<p="font-family:arial;"> My favorite actor in Whiplash is J.K. Simmons. He is able to potray a very unique character, and shows emotion while seeming very genuine as he acts.
